## Thesis

A lack of timeliness can have a variety of negative impacts on NuVu students. If a student is late, that student may not be getting enough sleep, which could result in lower productivity over the course of the day. NuCard is an ID system that models student attendance, promoting student accountability as well as creating a more streamlined system for taking attendance. Every morning, each NuVu student taps their card before entering the space. If the student is late, a screen prompts them to give a reason for why they were late. At the end of each trimester, students receive an email showing their attendance, as well as the most common reason for being late. NuCard will provide accurate and meaningful attendance data to NuVu students and staff. This data will allow coaches to give students more informed feedback and will encourage and reward timeliness.

## Goals
